Feature: Verify <numViews> attribute (from response) is greater than <value>

  Scenario Outline: numView attribute should be more than 4000
    Given API URL
    When We send a get request to get response
    Then We will check that value of <attribute> is greater than <value>

      | attribute | value |
      | numViews  | 4000  |
